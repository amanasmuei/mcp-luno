# ✅ WORKING SOLUTION - Luno MCP Server for Claude Desktop

This is the **definitive working solution** for running the Luno MCP server with Claude Desktop.

## 🚀 Immediate Fix (Copy & Paste Ready)

### Step 1: Update Claude Desktop Configuration

Open this file: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Replace its contents with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "luno": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": [
        "/Users/aman-asmuei/Documents/mcp/mcp-luno/src/luno_mcp_server/server.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/Users/aman-asmuei/Documents/mcp/mcp-luno",
      "env": {
        "LUNO_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "LUNO_API_SECRET": "your_api_secret_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Replace API Credentials

- Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Luno API key
- Replace `your_api_secret_here` with your actual Luno API secret
- If you don't have API credentials, remove the entire `env` section for public tools only

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop
2. Start it again
3. Wait for it to fully load

## ✅ What You'll Get

**Public Tools (No API credentials needed):**
- `get_crypto_price` - Get current Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. prices in ZAR
- `get_market_overview` - Get overview of all available markets

**Private Tools (API credentials required):**
- `get_account_balance` - Get your account balances

## 🧪 Test It Works

After restarting Claude Desktop, try asking:

1. **"What's the current Bitcoin price in EUR?"** or **"Get ETHZAR price"**
2. **"Show me the market overview"**
3. **"What's my account balance?"** (if you have API credentials)
4. **"Get crypto price for XBTGBP"** (Bitcoin in British Pounds)
5. **"What's the Ethereum price in ZAR?"**

## 🔧 Why This Works

- **No external dependencies** - Uses only Python standard library + httpx (which is available)
- **Standalone implementation** - Doesn't require FastMCP or other complex dependencies
- **Proper MCP protocol** - Implements the Model Context Protocol correctly
- **Error handling** - Provides clear error messages if something goes wrong

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your API credentials stay on your local machine
- They're passed as environment variables to the server
- Never share your API credentials or commit them to version control

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check the file path** - Make sure `/Users/aman-asmuei/Documents/mcp/mcp-luno/src/sync_working_server.py` exists
2. **Check JSON syntax** - Use a JSON validator to verify your config file
3. **Check Python** - Run `python3 --version` to ensure Python 3 is available
4. **Check permissions** - Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x /Users/aman-asmuei/Documents/mcp/mcp-luno/src/enhanced_working_server.py`
5. **Install httpx for real data** - Run `pip3 install httpx` for live price data (optional)

## 📞 Support

If you're still having issues, check:
- The Claude Desktop logs for error messages
