# ðŸš€ XBTMYR Trading Bot

## Moved to Standalone Repository

The XBTMYR trading bot has been moved to a separate directory to avoid confusion between the MCP server project and the trading bot application.

## New Location

The trading bot is now located at:
```
../xbtmyr-trading-bot/
```

## What's the Trading Bot?

Based on the market analysis performed using this MCP server, I created a complete production-ready trading bot that:

- **Uses Luno MCP Server Data**: Leverages the same API endpoints as this MCP server
- **Advanced Technical Analysis**: RSI, EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Professional Risk Management**: Stop losses, position sizing, portfolio protection
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and performance tracking
- **Safety First**: Dry-run mode, comprehensive logging, error handling

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to trading bot
cd ../xbtmyr-trading-bot

# Run automated setup
./setup.sh

# Test installation
python3 test_bot.py

# Run in simulation mode
python3 run_bot.py --dry-run
```

- **MCP Server**: Provides market data and analysis tools
- **Trading Bot**: Implements automated trading based on analysis
